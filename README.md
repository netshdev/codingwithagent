## 🚀 Quick Start

Initialize standardized rules in your project with a single command. **No installation required.**

```bash
npx codingwithagent init
```

The interactive CLI will guide you through the setup:

## 📦 Profiles

Choose the level of enforcement that fits your project maturity.

| Profile              | Description                                                                               | Best For                                     |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Minimal**       | Essential rules only. Focuses on readability and basic modern patterns.                   | Prototyping, Hackathons, Personal Projects   |
| **2. Standard** ⭐   | **Recommended.** Balanced set of best practices for React, Testing, and Security.         | Most Production Applications                 |
| **3. Strict**        | Maximum enforcement. TypeScript required, 90% test coverage, strict accessible standards. | Enterprise, Fintech, Healthcare, Large Teams |
| **4. Accessibility** | Heavy focus on WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, accessible patterns, and ARIA usage.               | Government, Public Sector, Inclusive Apps    |

## 🛠️ Supported Agents

We standardize instructions across the entire AI ecosystem.

### 1. Cursor (`.cursorrules`)

Generates a comprehensive system prompt file in your project root. Cursor reads this to understand your tech stack, testing requirements, and styling preferences before it writes a single line of code.

### 2. Windsurf (`.windsurfrules`)

Creates a rule file compatible with the Windsurf editor, ensuring your Cascade flows follow your engineering standards.

### 3. Google Antigravity (`.agent/rules/`)

Installs a modular rule set in the `.agent` directory. Antigravity acts as a "Universal" agent and can ingest these specific markdown files (e.g., `accessibility.md`, `testing.md`) to contextually apply rules based on the user's task.

### 4. GitHub Copilot (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)

Sets up project-specific instructions for GitHub Copilot Chat. This ensures Copilot suggests code that aligns with your specific architectural patterns.

### 5. Universal

A general-format rules file that works with most LLM-based tools that verify context files.

## 🎯 What's Included?

Depending on the profile, your rules will cover:

- **⚡ Tech Stack**: React, TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js patterns.
- **♿ Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA+ compliance, correct ARIA usage, semantic HTML.
- **🧪 Testing**: Unit (Jest/Vitest), Integration, and E2E testing standards.
- **🔒 Security**: Input validation, output sanitization, secret management (OpenSSF aligned).
- **🧠 Anti-Hallucinations**: Instructions to prevent AI from inventing libraries or APIs.
- **📁 File Structure**: component/container architecture, proper folder organization.

# Agentic Code Standards - Minimal Profile

# Version: 1.0.0

# Profile: Essential rules only - great for getting started

## Core Principles

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow basic accessibility guidelines
- Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns

## Accessibility Basics

- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible (Tab, Enter, Space)
- Provide alt text for images that convey information
- Use semantic HTML elements (button, nav, main, header, footer)
- Minimum color contrast: 4.5:1 for normal text

## Code Quality

- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Prefer `const` over `let`, never use `var`
- Keep functions small and focused (under 50 lines)
- Remove `console.log` statements before committing

## React Essentials

- Use functional components with hooks
- Destructure props: `const Component = ({prop1, prop2}) => {}`
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Keep components under 200 lines

## Testing

- Write tests for critical functionality
- Test user behavior, not implementation details
- Mock external dependencies

## Security

- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Validate user inputs
- Use environment variables for configuration
